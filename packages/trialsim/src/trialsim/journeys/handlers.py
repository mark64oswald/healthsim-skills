"""TrialSim-specific event handlers for the journey engine.

This module provides handlers for TrialSim clinical trial events that can be registered
with the core JourneyEngine. Handlers generate the appropriate outputs
(screening records, randomization, visits, adverse events, etc.) when events are executed.

The handlers wrap the core healthsim.generation.handlers.TrialSimHandlers class
and provide a consistent interface matching MemberSim, RxMemberSim, and PatientSim patterns.
