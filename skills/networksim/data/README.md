# NetworkSim Data Package

**Version**: 2.0  
**Last Updated**: December 28, 2025  
**Location**: `healthsim.duckdb` (network schema)

---

## Overview

NetworkSim v2.0 is a data-driven network analytics product built on real healthcare provider data. Unlike v1.0's synthetic generation, v2.0 queries actual NPPES, CMS, and HRSA datasets for authentic provider lookups, network analysis, and cross-product analytics.

**Key Feature**: Geographic enrichment enables cross-schema JOINs with PopulationSim demographic data for healthcare access analysis.

---

## Database Schema: `network`

### Tables Summary

| Table | Records | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **providers** | 8.9M | Active US healthcare providers (NPPES) |

| **physician_quality** | 1.5M | Physician performance metrics (CMS Physician Compare) |
| **ahrf_county** | 3.2K | County-level workforce data (HRSA AHRF) |

**Total Size**: ~1.2 GB  
**Geographic Coverage**: 97.77% of providers have county FIPS codes  
**Counties Covered**: 3,213 (exceeds PopulationSim's 3,143)

## Cross-Schema Integration

### Join Keys with PopulationSim

| NetworkSim Column | PopulationSim Table | Join Column |
|-------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| county_fips | population.svi_county | stcnty |
| county_fips | population.places_county | locationid |
| county_fips | population.svi_tract | (first 5 digits of FIPS) |

### Example Cross-Product Queries

**Healthcare Access + Social Vulnerability**:
```sql
SELECT 
    s.county,
    s.state,
    s.rpl_themes as svi_percentile,
    COUNT(DISTINCT p.npi) as provider_count,
    s.e_totpop as population,
    ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT p.npi) * 100000.0 / s.e_totpop, 1) as per_100k
FROM population.svi_county s
LEFT JOIN network.providers p ON s.stcnty = p.county_fips
WHERE s.rpl_themes >= 0.75  -- Top quartile vulnerability
GROUP BY s.county, s.state, s.rpl_themes, s.e_totpop
ORDER BY per_100k ASC;
```

**Healthcare Deserts + Disease Burden**:
```sql
SELECT 
    s.county,
    COUNT(p.npi) * 100000.0 / s.e_totpop as providers_per_100k,
    pl.diabetes_crudeprev as diabetes_rate,
    s.rpl_themes as vulnerability
FROM population.svi_county s
LEFT JOIN network.providers p ON s.stcnty = p.county_fips
LEFT JOIN population.places_county pl ON s.stcnty = pl.locationid
GROUP BY s.county, s.e_totpop, pl.diabetes_crudeprev, s.rpl_themes
HAVING COUNT(p.npi) * 100000.0 / s.e_totpop < 40
ORDER BY diabetes_rate DESC;
```
