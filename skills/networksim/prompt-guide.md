## Tips for Effective Prompts

### Be Specific About Geography

✅ Good:
```
Generate a cardiologist in Harris County, Texas
```

❌ Avoid:
```
Generate a doctor in Texas
```

**Why**: Specific geography produces realistic addresses, phone numbers, hospital affiliations, and correct county FIPS codes.

---

### Specify Specialty When Relevant

✅ Good:
```
Generate an interventional cardiologist
```

❌ Avoid:
```
Generate a heart doctor
```

**Why**: Specific specialties map to correct taxonomy codes (207RC0001X vs 207RC0000X) and realistic credentials (FSCAI).

---

### Include Context for Integration

✅ Good:
```
Generate a provider for this heart failure patient's cardiology referral
[Include patient context: diagnosis, location]
```

❌ Avoid:
```
Generate a provider
```

**Why**: Context enables matching specialty to diagnosis, geography to patient location, and appropriate credentials for the care setting.

---

### Request Specific Output When Needed

✅ Good:
```
Generate a provider with full taxonomy codes and board certifications
```

❌ Avoid:
```
Generate a provider
```

**Why**: Default output may omit optional fields like secondary taxonomies, hospital privileges, or board certification details.

---

### Use Multiple Prompts for Complex Needs

✅ Good:
```
1. "Explain specialty pharmacy concepts"
2. "Generate a specialty pharmacy for oncology"
3. "Add this pharmacy to the member's network"
```

❌ Avoid:
```
Do everything related to specialty pharmacy
```

**Why**: Breaking into steps produces more accurate, complete results and allows for verification at each stage.

---

### Reference Existing Entities

✅ Good:
```
Generate 3 more cardiologists affiliated with the same hospital
[Reference: CCN 450358 - Houston Methodist]
```

❌ Avoid:
```
Generate more doctors
```

**Why**: Maintaining entity references ensures consistency across related providers.

---

### Specify Network Context

✅ Good:
```
Generate a provider for this HMO member's referral
[Include: HMO network constraints, PCP referral]
```

❌ Avoid:
```
Generate a specialist
```

**Why**: Network type affects which providers are valid, referral requirements, and cost sharing.
