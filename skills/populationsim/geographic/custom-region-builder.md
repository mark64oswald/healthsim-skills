# Custom Region Builder Skill

## Overview

The custom-region-builder skill creates PopulationProfile objects for user-defined geographic regions by aggregating data from component counties, census tracts, or ZIP codes. This enables analysis of healthcare service areas, health plan markets, and other non-standard geographic units.

**Primary Use Cases**:
- Hospital/health system service area profiling
- Health plan market area analysis
- ACO attributed population characterization
- FQHC service area assessment
- Clinical trial catchment area analysis
- Custom regional comparisons

**Key Capability**: Combine arbitrary geographic units into a unified profile with proper aggregation methodology.

## Trigger Phrases

- "Create a profile for our service area: [list of counties]"
- "Combine [counties/tracts] into a custom region"
- "Profile our market area covering [geographies]"
- "What's the population for these counties together: [list]"
- "Build a catchment area profile for [counties]"
- "Aggregate demographics for [list of geographies]"
- "Custom region including [geography list]"

## Generation Patterns

### Pattern 1: Multi-County Service Area

**Input**: "Create a profile for our service area: Harris, Fort Bend, and Montgomery counties in Texas"

**Process**:
1. Validate all county identifiers
2. Pull ACS demographics for each county
3. Sum populations, calculate weighted averages
4. Pull and aggregate CDC PLACES health indicators
5. Calculate region-level SDOH from tract data
6. Assemble unified PopulationProfile

**Output**: Combined region profile with component breakdown

### Pattern 2: Tract-Based Catchment

**Input**: "Build a catchment area from these census tracts: [list of 25 tracts]"

**Process**:
1. Validate all tract FIPS codes
2. Determine parent county/counties
3. Sum tract populations
4. Weight demographics by tract population
5. Aggregate health indicators and SDOH
6. Identify geographic extent

**Output**: Tract-aggregate profile

### Pattern 3: Multi-State Region

**Input**: "Profile the tri-state area: NY, NJ, and CT portions of the NYC metro"

**Process**:
1. Identify counties in NYC CBSA
2. Group by state
3. Create sub-region profiles
4. Aggregate to full region
5. Show state-by-state breakdown

**Output**: Multi-state region with sub-region detail

## Validation Rules

### Input Validation
- All component geographies must be valid identifiers
- Component types must be consistent (all counties, all tracts, etc.)
- Overlapping components flagged (e.g., county + tracts within same county)

### Output Validation
- [ ] All components successfully resolved
- [ ] Population totals match sum of components
- [ ] Weighted averages correctly calculated
- [ ] No double-counting of population
- [ ] SVI aggregated from component tracts

### Aggregation Methods

| Metric Type | Method |
|-------------|--------|
| Population counts | Sum |
| Percentages/rates | Population-weighted average |
| Medians | Cannot aggregate; use weighted estimate |
| SVI | Recalculate from tract-level or weighted average |
| Counts (hospitals, etc.) | Sum |
