# Census Tract Analysis Skill

## Overview

The census-tract-analysis skill provides granular neighborhood-level population intelligence by analyzing census tracts (~4,000 population each). This enables identification of health hotspots, vulnerable communities, and SDOH concentrations that county-level analysis would miss.

**Primary Use Cases**:
- Identify high-vulnerability neighborhoods
- Target community health interventions
- Find health disparity hotspots
- Support FQHC service area analysis
- Enable precise cohort targeting

**Key Advantage**: Census tracts reveal within-county variation that aggregate county data masks.

## Generation Patterns

### Pattern 1: High-Vulnerability Tract Identification

**Input**: "Find high-SVI tracts in Los Angeles County"

**Process**:
1. Load all LA County tracts (~2,500 tracts)
2. Filter to SVI ≥ 0.75
3. Sort by SVI descending
4. Aggregate demographics and health indicators
5. Identify common characteristics

**Output**: List of high-vulnerability tracts with profiles

### Pattern 2: Disease Hotspot Detection

**Input**: "Identify diabetes hotspots in Houston area"

**Process**:
1. Load Harris County and adjacent county tracts
2. Pull CDC PLACES diabetes prevalence
3. Calculate z-scores vs county average
4. Flag tracts > 1.5 standard deviations
5. Cluster adjacent hotspot tracts

**Output**: Diabetes hotspot clusters with demographics

### Pattern 3: Disparity Analysis

**Input**: "Compare tract-level diabetes rates by SVI quartile in Cook County"

**Process**:
1. Load all Cook County tracts
2. Assign SVI quartile to each tract
3. Calculate mean diabetes prevalence by quartile
4. Calculate gradient and significance
5. Identify exemplar tracts

**Output**: Disparity gradient with tract examples

## Validation Rules

### Input Validation
- Geography must resolve to valid county or tract list
- SVI thresholds must be between 0 and 1
- Population minimums must be positive integers

### Output Validation
- [ ] Tract FIPS codes are valid 11-digit format
- [ ] SVI values between 0 and 1
- [ ] Percentages between 0 and 1
- [ ] Population values are positive integers
- [ ] Tracts sum to expected county totals

### Data Quality Notes
- Tracts with population < 500 have less reliable estimates
- ACS 5-year estimates required for tract-level data
- CDC PLACES tract data may have higher MOE for small tracts
- SVI not available for tracts with missing ACS data
