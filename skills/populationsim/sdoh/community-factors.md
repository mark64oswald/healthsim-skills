# Community Factors Skill

## Overview

The community-factors skill analyzes neighborhood and community-level factors that influence health, including housing conditions, transportation access, food environment, and environmental quality. These structural factors create the context in which health behaviors and outcomes occur.

**Primary Use Cases**:
- Housing quality and stability assessment
- Transportation barrier identification
- Food access/desert analysis
- Environmental health assessment
- Neighborhood effect quantification

---

## Trigger Phrases

- "Food deserts in [geography]"
- "Transportation access in [area]"
- "Housing conditions in [geography]"
- "Community health factors for [area]"
- "Environmental health in [region]"
- "Neighborhood factors affecting health"
