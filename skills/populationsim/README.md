# PopulationSim

**Status**: Planned

PopulationSim will generate synthetic population demographics and social determinants of health (SDOH) data.

## Overview

PopulationSim addresses a key gap in synthetic healthcare data: realistic population-level demographics that can drive other HealthSim products. Instead of generating patients with random demographics, PopulationSim will provide:

- Realistic demographic distributions based on actual census data
- Geographic clustering and patterns
- Social determinants of health factors
- Cohort definitions for targeted data generation

## Use Cases

1. **Population Health Analytics Testing**
   - Generate populations with specific demographic profiles
   - Test SDOH-based risk stratification models
   - Validate health equity analyses

2. **Provider Network Planning**
   - Model service area demographics
   - Analyze access patterns
   - Test network adequacy calculations

3. **Clinical Trial Recruitment**
   - Generate realistic recruitment pools
   - Model geographic accessibility
   - Simulate diversity requirements

4. **Member Population Modeling**
   - Generate plan member demographics
   - Model geographic distribution
   - Test premium pricing models

## Development Roadmap

| Phase | Focus | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Core demographic model | Planned |
| 2 | Census-based distributions | Planned |
| 3 | SDOH index integration | Planned |
| 4 | Geographic cohorts | Planned |
| 5 | Cross-product integration | Planned |
