# Recruitment & Enrollment

Generate realistic clinical trial recruitment funnels, screening patterns, and enrollment data. This skill bridges PatientSim patients to TrialSim subjects through the screening and consent process.

---

## For Claude

This is an **operational skill** for generating recruitment and enrollment data. Apply this when users want screening funnels, screen failures, consent workflows, or enrollment patterns.

**Always apply this skill when you see:**
- References to screening, pre-screening, or enrollment
- Requests for screen failures or screen failure rates
- Mentions of informed consent or ICF
- Inclusion/exclusion criteria evaluation
- Enrollment funnel or recruitment metrics
- Randomization or treatment assignment

**Combine with:**
- Phase scenario skills for trial-specific I/E criteria
- Therapeutic area skills for indication-specific eligibility
- PatientSim for source patient demographics

---

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user:
- Wants to generate screening and enrollment data
- Needs realistic screen failure rates and reasons
- Asks about informed consent patterns
- Wants to see the journey from patient to subject
- Needs enrollment velocity patterns by site
- Requests randomization with stratification

## The Recruitment Funnel

### Funnel Stages

```
Clinical Trial Recruitment Funnel
==================================

IDENTIFIED (100%)
  Potential subjects from referrals, EMR, advertising, patient databases
       |
       | ✗ 40-60% drop: No contact, not interested, ineligible on basic criteria
       v
PRE-SCREENED (40-60%)
  Initial eligibility check (phone/chart), Basic I/E criteria review
       |
       | ✗ 10-20% drop: Declined consent, logistics, changed mind
       v
CONSENTED (30-40%)
  Signed informed consent form, Entered screening period
       |
       | ✗ 5-15% drop: Failed screening labs/imaging, disease criteria not met
       v
SCREEN PASSED (20-30%)
  Met all I/E criteria, Eligible for enrollment
       |
       | ✗ 2-5% drop: Withdrew before randomization, slot not available
       v
RANDOMIZED (15-25%)
  Assigned to treatment arm, Officially enrolled
```

### Funnel Benchmarks by Therapeutic Area

| Therapeutic Area | Screen Failure Rate | Top Failure Reasons |
|------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Oncology** | 25-40% | Wrong stage/histology, prior therapy, organ function |
| **Cardiovascular** | 20-35% | Ejection fraction, comorbidities, concomitant meds |
| **CNS/Neurology** | 30-45% | Cognitive scores, disease duration, MRI findings |
| **Diabetes/Metabolic** | 15-25% | HbA1c range, renal function, cardiovascular history |
| **Rare Disease** | 35-50% | Genetic confirmation, disease severity, prior treatment |
| **Healthy Volunteers** | 10-20% | Labs, ECG, drug screen, medical history |

## Randomization

### Randomization Methods

| Method | Description | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Simple** | Pure random assignment | Small Phase I studies |
| **Block** | Balanced within blocks | Most Phase II/III trials |
| **Stratified** | Balanced within strata | When prognostic factors matter |
| **Dynamic/Minimization** | Real-time balancing | Complex stratification |

### Stratification Factors (Common)

| Factor | Levels | Typical Trials |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Region | NA vs EU vs Asia | Global trials |
| ECOG PS | 0 vs 1 | Oncology |
| Prior therapy | Yes vs No | Most trials |
| Disease stage | Early vs Advanced | Oncology |
| Biomarker status | Positive vs Negative | Targeted therapy |
| Sex | Male vs Female | CV, rare disease |
| Age group | <65 vs ≥65 | Geriatric considerations |

### Randomization Output

```json

  "randomization": {
    "subject_id": "ABC-001-0001",
    "randomization_date": "2024-06-28",

  }
}

## Site Enrollment Patterns

### Enrollment Velocity by Site Type

| Site Type | Subjects/Month | Characteristics |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| **High Performer** | 4-8 | Academic center, dedicated staff, large patient pool |
| **Average** | 1-3 | Community practice, part-time coordinator |
| **Low/Struggling** | 0-1 | Small practice, competing priorities |
| **Non-enrolling** | 0 | Activated but no subjects (5-10% of sites) |

### Enrollment Timeline Pattern

```
Site Activation: Month 0
├── Slow start (Months 1-2): 0-1 subjects
├── Ramp-up (Months 3-4): 1-2 subjects/month
├── Steady state (Months 5+): Consistent enrollment
└── Tail (final months): Declining as slots fill
```

---

## Generation Patterns

### Pattern 1: Basic Enrollment Funnel

**Request:** "Generate screening data for 100 randomized subjects with 25% screen failure rate"

**Calculation:**
- Target randomized: 100
- Screen failure rate: 25%
- Consented needed: 100 / 0.75 = 134

**Output Distribution:**
| Stage | N | % of Consented |
|-------|---|----------------|
| Consented | 134 | 100% |
| Screen Passed | 100 | 75% |
| Screen Failed | 34 | 25% |

### Pattern 2: Detailed Screen Failures

**Request:** "Generate 50 screen failures for an oncology trial"

**Distribution by Category:**
| Category | N | % | Top Reasons |
|----------|---|---|-------------|
| Disease-related | 18 | 36% | Wrong stage (8), histology (5), prior therapy (5) |
| Laboratory | 14 | 28% | Organ function (8), hematology (6) |
| Medical history | 10 | 20% | Comorbidity (6), prior malignancy (4) |
| Administrative | 8 | 16% | Consent withdrawn (5), lost to FU (3) |
