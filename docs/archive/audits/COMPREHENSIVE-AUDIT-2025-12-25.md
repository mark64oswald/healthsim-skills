## 2. Documentation Audit

### ✅ No Critical Gaps

| Document | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| README.md (root) | ✅ Complete | Good navigation, "I Want To..." table |
| SKILL.md (root) | ✅ Complete | Master router with all products |
| docs/README.md | ✅ Complete | Comprehensive navigation hub |
| hello-healthsim/ | ✅ Complete | All products have examples |
| CHANGELOG.md | ✅ Complete | Well-maintained |

### ⚠️ Minor Gaps Found

| Gap | Location | Priority | Action |
|-----|----------|----------|--------|
| Missing README | `formats/` | Low | Create index of all format files |
| Missing README | `references/` | Low | Create index of reference files |
| Duplicate templates | `docs/skills/` | Low | Remove SKILL_TEMPLATE.md, SKILL_TEMPLATE_V2.md (superseded by docs/skills-template.md) |

---

## 3. Python Packages Audit

### ⛔ BLOCKING: Dependency Configuration Errors

The Python packages have **inconsistent dependency naming** that prevents installation and testing.

| Package | Declared Dependency | Actual Package Name | Status |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------|--------|
| patientsim | `healthsim-core>=0.4.0` | `healthsim-common` (v1.0.0) | ❌ Mismatch |
| membersim | `healthsim-core @ git+...` | `healthsim-common` (v1.0.0) | ❌ Mismatch |
| rxmembersim | (need to check) | `healthsim-common` (v1.0.0) | ❌ Likely mismatch |

**Impact**: 
- `pip install -e packages/patientsim` fails
- All pytest tests fail with `ModuleNotFoundError`
- MCP servers cannot be started

**Root Cause**: packages/core defines `name = "healthsim-common"` but other packages reference `healthsim-core`.

**Fix Required**:
1. Either rename packages/core to `healthsim-core` in pyproject.toml
2. Or update all dependent packages to reference `healthsim-common`

### Package Structure Status

| Package | src/ | tests/ | CLAUDE.md | README.md | pyproject.toml |
|---------|------|--------|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| core | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ Missing | ✅ | ✅ |
| patientsim | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| membersim | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| rxmembersim | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

**Note**: TrialSim, PopulationSim, and NetworkSim do not have Python packages yet (intentional - they're skill-only products).

## 4. Folder Structure Audit

### ✅ Overall Structure is Clean

```
healthsim-workspace/
├── README.md              ✅ Clean root
├── SKILL.md               ✅
├── CHANGELOG.md           ✅
├── docs/                  ✅ Archive cleaned up
├── formats/               ⚠️ Missing README
├── references/            ⚠️ Missing README
├── hello-healthsim/       ✅
├── packages/              ⚠️ Dependency issues

```

### ⚠️ Minor Structural Issues

| Issue | Location | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Inconsistent tutorial structure | `hello-healthsim/populationsim/` | PopulationSim has dedicated tutorial folder, others don't |
| scenarios/saved | `scenarios/saved/` | Consider if these should be in hello-healthsim/examples |
